# micro-next-workshop

In this workshop, we learn how to build a complete web application architecture based on Node.JS. We will create a microservice for JSON endpoints with micro, a lightweight framework for async HTTP micro services. We will see how easy it is to test such a service. We will use it by creating a Universal JavaScript app, using next.js, for server-rendered JavaScript web apps, built on top of React, Webpack and Babel, and utilizing the microservice both from the server and from the client. Finally, we will deploy both the app and the microservice, using now - a lightweight way to deploy applications on the web.
